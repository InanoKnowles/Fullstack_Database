# Full Stack Database
My second project with General Assembly is to create a database on any topic that I choose.

## Updates:
### Monday 12th December 2022:

The project was handed out today - We were asked to prepare a 30 second pitch for tomorrow.

At first I wanted to focus on making a dating application for a game but I would have added a hilarious seagull twist.

After a little reflection - I've come to the realisation that it should serve a purpose beyond making myself laugh.

I've decided to pause and think about:
- What will my database do?
- How does it help those who use it?
- Is this a service that is needed?

When I have decided what that is I'll return with another update.

Update 1: 

The project I've decided to go with creating a digital command board for a household.

This helps those living together to work towards goals, stay organised and keep everyone up to date with each member's schedule.

After living in a few share housing situations and then being trapped inside isolation whilst having covid - It was difficult to ask for help with a sore throat and those who are immune compromised had to wait until they got home to find out that they may need to take extra precautions.

With my app idea I hope to make the line of communication more transparent, considerate and useful for those living together.

At first I was going to avoid using APIs all together because I genuinely find them to be my personal weakness. However, if I avoid the things I struggle with - How can I ever hope to improve and master that weakness? 

That being said - I've decided to challenge myself with using a [Google Calendar API:](https://developers.google.com/calendar)

Update 2: 

I have finally managed to link this repository to my local terminal.

Now that I know what I want to make and what tools I want to use lets get to planning, wireframing and hopefully get started on some coding today :heart: 

Here is my current list for what I like to call my tool kit:

**Planning this project:**
- Pen and paper
- Figma
- Canva

**Creating this project:**
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS

Trello board that we were asked to provide to the teacher - It become immediately apparent that I use it very differently to the other students.:sweat_smile:

Update 1: 

Coding files is up and running.

I have my first webpage working, small wins yay.:notes:

Today's goal is to hit MVP!
