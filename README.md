# Full Stack Database
My second project with General Assembly is to create a database on any topic that I choose.

## Updates:
### Monday 12th December 2022:

The project was handed out today - We were asked to prepare a 30 second pitch for tomorrow.

At first I wanted to focus on making a dating application for a game but I would have added a hilarious seagull twist.

After a little reflection - I've come to the realisation that it should serve a purpose beyond making myself laugh.

I've decided to pause and think about:
- What will my database do?
- How does it help those who use it?
- Is this a service that is needed?

When I have decided what that is I'll return with another update.
