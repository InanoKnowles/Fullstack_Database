# Full Stack Database
My second project with General Assembly is to create a database on any topic that I choose.

Feel free to go through my UPDATES section to follow my learnings whilst working on this project.

## About

My project is a basic to do list
- Main feature: Allows you to assign individual tasks to different users and edit.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

I originally planned for it to have a lot of features for organising households but as I got deeper into the project, I realised there are a lot of things I need to work on to become a better software designer.
I'm excited to continue this project in the future. I'm in love with the challenges that give me learning opportunities.

## :rocket: Cool tech

**Planning this project:**
- Pen and paper
- Figma
- Canva

**Creating this project:**
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:

- When you click on DONE for the 2nd time we get a unicode error
- I recently fixed the sign up bug where I was giving 3 arguments instead of 4 that were expected
- Deployment issues on fly.io

## :sob: Lessons learnt

- Plan and do projects at YOUR CURRENT level NOT your future selfs level
- Avoid forcefully pushing up to GitHub
- Push up often and as soon as the first error appears get help ASAP 
- Ask lots of questions but be extra specific

## :white_check_mark: Future Features

- Adding more command centre features to my app and make it responsive
- Adding API's 
- Make my site look more clean and uncluttered
- I would love to make a theme on it

## Updates:

### Monday 12th December 2022:

The project was handed out today - We were asked to prepare a 30 second pitch for tomorrow.

At first I wanted to focus on making a dating application for a game but I would have added a hilarious seagull twist.

After a little reflection - I've come to the realisation that it should serve a purpose beyond making myself laugh.

I've decided to pause and think about:
- What will my database do?
- How does it help those who use it?
- Is this a service that is needed?

When I have decided what that is I'll return with another update.

### Tuesday 13th December 2022:

Update 1: 

The project I've decided to go with creating a digital command board for a household.

This helps those living together to work towards goals, stay organised and keep everyone up to date with each member's schedule.

After living in a few share housing situations and then being trapped inside isolation whilst having covid - It was difficult to ask for help with a sore throat and those who are immune compromised had to wait until they got home to find out that they may need to take extra precautions.

With my app idea I hope to make the line of communication more transparent, considerate and useful for those living together.

At first I was going to avoid using APIs all together because I genuinely find them to be my personal weakness. However, if I avoid the things I struggle with - How can I ever hope to improve and master that weakness? 

That being said - I've decided to challenge myself with using a [Google Calendar API:](https://developers.google.com/calendar)

Update 2: 

I have finally managed to link this repository to my local terminal.

Now that I know what I want to make and what tools I want to use lets get to planning, wireframing and hopefully get started on some coding today :heart: 

Here is my current list for what I like to call my tool kit:

**Planning this project:**
- Pen and paper
- Figma
- Canva

**Creating this project:**
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS

Trello board that we were asked to provide to the teacher - It become immediately apparent that I use it very differently to the other students.:sweat_smile:

Update 1: 

Coding files is up and running.

I have my first webpage working, small wins yay.:notes:

Today's goal is to hit MVP!


Update 2: 

I had a bit of a hiccup with editing tasks inside browser - Thankfully that was fixed with checking for SPELLING MISTAKES :joy:

It has also become quite clear that I need to water down the whole project concept more so that my current skillset matches the scope.

Definitely something I will have in due time but not at this very moment. 

Currently I need to add just one feature into my project and it will hit MVP.

I need to find a way for the assigned task to show on the browser.

### Thursday 15th December 2022:

Update 1:

I'm in a bit of a pickle.

I want this:

But I just keep getting this:

![Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 6 58 32 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/207713451-d97d833b-1cbd-4e0a-9650-d452dddd7abd.png)


I've tried creating section classes to isolate the elements that I want to play with, I've tried grouping them all together and I've tried putting them into different files - Obviously none of those work. Is the cheeky bugger hiding inside the CSS?

### Friday 16th December 2022:

I tried to deploy to fly.io and in following the instructions a bit TOO closely I went and made new .git file/repository inside my current repository. Pushed my code up with -f RAGEEEEE!

And now my sign up botton is being an egg. 

On the bright side my css is doing what I wanted now yay for small wins.
