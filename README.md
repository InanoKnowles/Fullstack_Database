# Full Stack Database
My second project with General Assembly is to create a database on any topic that I choose.

## Updates:
### Monday 12th December 2022:

The project was handed out today - We were asked to prepare a 30 second pitch for tomorrow.

At first I wanted to focus on making a dating application for a game but I would have added a hilarious seagull twist.

After a little reflection - I've come to the realisation that it should serve a purpose beyond making myself laugh.

I've decided to pause and think about:
- What will my database do?
- How does it help those who use it?
- Is this a service that is needed?

When I have decided what that is I'll return with another update.

The project I've decided to go by is creating a digital command board for a household.

This helps those living together to work towards goals, stay organised and keep everyone up to date with each member's schedule.

After living in a few share housing situations and then being trapped inside isolation whilst having covid - It was difficult to ask for help with a sore throat and those who are immune compromised had to wait until they got home to find out that they may need to take extra precautions.

With my app idea I hope to make the line of communication more transparent, considerate and useful for those living together.

At first I was going to avoid using APIs all together because I genuinely find them to be my personal weakness. However, if I avoid the things I struggle with - How can I ever hope to improve and master that weakness? 

That being said - I've decided to challenge myself with using a [Google Calendar API:](https://developers.google.com/calendar)
